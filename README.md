**Introduction**
Marine debris is an important environmental issue of the 21st century threatening the marine biodiversity, the stability of the marine ecosystem, and the coastal economies significantly. The debris of plastics, metals, glass as well as discarded fishing nets in the oceans require smart automated systems that can identify effectively and in real-time. Nevertheless, traditional image-based detection systems are usually not effective where there are variations in underwater light, occlusions, and dynamic marine environments. To overcome these weaknesses, this paper will present a hybrid deep learning model that uses quantum-inspired encoding with Torch Quantum layers and combines with the YOLOv8 object detector to classify marine debris more accurately. The Quantum ResNet will provide a better representation of both global and local contextual features. Angel encoding and variational learning are done using the parameters of rotation gates, such as RY and RZ. The model will be trained on a limited dataset of 3,000 checked images of marine debris that will be classified into plastic, metal, glass, and fishing nets. The hybrid network is trained by Stochastic Gradient Descent and its learning rate is carefully adjusted. The results of the experiment show high performance and 91.3% mAP 0.5, 93.7% precision, 89.2% recall, better than base YOLOv8n, which reveals good prospects of marine monitoring and sustainability system implementation in real time.
**DATASET**
The model will be trained on a limited dataset of 3,000 checked images of marine debris that will be classified into plastic, metal, glass, and fishing nets. The hybrid network is trained by Stochastic Gradient Descent and its learning rate is carefully adjusted. The data to be used in this research is a filtered collection of 3,000 images of marine litter available on several open-access platforms, such as drone videos of the coastline, coastline imagery databases, and marine litter tracking libraries. The dataset takes a broad range of types of materials of the waste, including plastic bottles, fishing nets, metallic waste, rubber, and glass fragments, under different environmental conditions. The annotations of every image take the form of label files in YOLO format, which include: \text{class_id} \quad x_{center} \quad y_{center} \quad width \quad height, where all coordinates are normalized to the image dimensions

Training	- 2,250 -	Used for model learning and optimization
Validation -	450	- Used for hyperparameter tuning and early stopping
Testing	- 300 -	Used for final evaluation of detection performance
Each subset contains both image files (.jpg, .png) and corresponding label files (.txt), ensuring compatibility with YOLOv8’s built-in data loader.

**Data Preprocessing and Augmentation**
Marine debris images vary significantly in resolution, background complexity, and lighting conditions. To enhance model generalization and reduce overfitting, extensive data preprocessing and augmentation were performed using YOLO’s augmentation engine and PyTorch transforms.
