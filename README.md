Marine debris is an important environmental issue of the 21st century threatening the marine biodiversity, the stability of the marine ecosystem, and the coastal economies significantly. The debris of plastics, metals, glass as well as discarded fishing nets in the oceans require smart automated systems that can identify effectively and in real-time. Nevertheless, traditional image-based detection systems are usually not effective where there are variations in underwater light, occlusions, and dynamic marine environments. To overcome these weaknesses, this paper will present a hybrid deep learning model that uses quantum-inspired encoding with Torch Quantum layers and combines with the YOLOv8 object detector to classify marine debris more accurately. The Quantum ResNet will provide a better representation of both global and local contextual features. Angel encoding and variational learning are done using the parameters of rotation gates, such as RY and RZ. The model will be trained on a limited dataset of 3,000 checked images of marine debris that will be classified into plastic, metal, glass, and fishing nets. The hybrid network is trained by Stochastic Gradient Descent and its learning rate is carefully adjusted. The results of the experiment show high performance and 91.3% mAP 0.5, 93.7% precision, 89.2% recall, better than base YOLOv8n, which reveals good prospects of marine monitoring and sustainability system implementation in real time.
